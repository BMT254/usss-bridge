USSD Bitcoin Voucher Bridge A Pi Zero-based tool that listens to Bitcoin USSD tones on feature phones and prints redeemable QR vouchers. No internet connection needed – ideal for areas with shutdowns. ## How It Works The script captures USSD tones sent from a feature phone (via Bitcoin USSD service), decodes them, and prints a QR code the user can scan later to redeem funds once service returns. ## Features - Offline operation - MIT licensed - Provider-agnostic – works with any Bitcoin USSD service ## Setup 1. Connect Pi Zero to a speaker or audio line-in from the feature phone. 2. Run the script. 3. Print QR vouchers on demand. Tested on multiple phones and tones – works every time.
